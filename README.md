# Google Spreadsheet Cloud Expense Tracker

## About

This project is about a Python CLI application that uses the [gspread is a Python API for Google Sheets](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/index.html) package to connect to the Google Spreadsheets API and logs expenses in a spreadsheet. The app supports all four CRUD operations â€“ adding a new expense, listing all expenses, editing an expense and deleting an expense.

## Motivation

- Experiment with the Google Sheets API and gspread
- Learn how to use Python to write data to cloud-based files
- Transition from storing expenses in a local CSV file to managing them remotely
